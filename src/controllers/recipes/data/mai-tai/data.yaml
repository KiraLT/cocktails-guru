name: Mai Tai
description: >
    The Mai Tai, a tropical cocktail blending rum, lime juice, orange cura√ßao, and orgeat syrup, was created in the 1940s by Victor J. Bergeron, better known as Trader Vic.
    Born in the tiki culture era, its name reportedly comes from the Tahitian phrase meaning "out of this world." The Mai Tai's exotic, sweet-tart flavor profile continues to encapsulate the spirit of Polynesian paradise.
