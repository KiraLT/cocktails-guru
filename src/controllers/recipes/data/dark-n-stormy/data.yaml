    - Garnish with a lime wedge.
ingredients:
    spiced rum: 2
    ginger beer: 4
    lime juice: 0.5
tips:
    - Not all ginger beers are created equal. Look for a brand that has a strong, spicy ginger flavor. Bundaberg, Fever-Tree, and Gosling's all make excellent ginger beers that work well in a Dark 'N' Stormy.
    - A Dark 'N' Stormy is traditionally made with Gosling's Black Seal Rum. Its rich, deep flavor perfectly complements the spicy ginger beer. Using a different dark rum can significantly alter the taste of the cocktail.
    - If you want to create a "stormy" effect in the glass, pour the ginger beer in first, then slowly pour the rum over the back of a spoon onto the ginger beer. This will create a layer of dark rum on top of the ginger beer.
