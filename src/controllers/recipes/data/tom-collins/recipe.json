    "description": "The Tequila Sunrise, with its visually striking gradient of colors, was reimagined in the 1970s in Sausalito, California. It layers tequila, orange juice, and grenadine, symbolizing a colorful dawn. Immortalized in a song by the Eagles and a film with the same name, it's a cocktail that transcends the bar, becoming a pop culture icon.",
