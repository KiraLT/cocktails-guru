name: Spiced Rum
description: >
    Spiced rums obtain their flavors through the addition of spices and, sometimes, caramel.
    Most are darker in colour, and based on gold rums.
    Some are significantly darker, while many cheaper brands are made from inexpensive white rums and darkened with caramel colour.
    Among the spices added are cinnamon, rosemary, absinthe/aniseed, pepper, cloves, and cardamom.
