    "description": "The Gin & Tonic, a simple yet elegant mix of gin and tonic water garnished with a slice of lime or lemon, has roots in 19th century British colonial India. Originally consumed for its quinine content as a preventative measure against malaria, it quickly gained popularity as a refreshing drink. Today, its botanical notes and crisp, effervescent finish make it a timeless classic enjoyed worldwide.",
