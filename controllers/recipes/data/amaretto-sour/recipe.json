    "name": "The Amaretto Sour is a post-World War II American classic that beautifully combines the sweet almond flavor of Amaretto, a liqueur originally from Italy, with the tartness of lemon juice. Often topped with a maraschino cherry or an orange slice, it offers a delightful balance of sweet and sour. This cocktail's enticing mix of flavors and its rich, velvety texture make it a perennial favorite.",
