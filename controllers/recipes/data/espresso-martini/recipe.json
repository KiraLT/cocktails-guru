    "name": "Espresso Martini",
    "description": "The Espresso Martini, a stimulating blend of vodka, coffee liqueur, and freshly brewed espresso, was invented in the 1980s by London bartender Dick Bradsell. Conceived as a wake-up call for a patron requesting a drink that would \"wake her up and mess her up\", it quickly gained popularity. Today, its blend of boozy warmth and caffeinated kick makes it a beloved after-dinner cocktail and party pick-me-up.",

    "tips": [
        "For a different twist, try replacing vodka with whiskey, such as bourbon or rye. This changes the flavor profile, offering a unique take on the classic Espresso Martini.",
        "The amount of simple syrup can be adjusted based on your preference for sweetness. If it's too sweet, reduce the syrup; if it's not sweet enough, feel free to add a bit more.",
        "Serve the Espresso Martini in a chilled glass. You can chill the glass by placing it in the freezer for a few minutes before you start preparing the cocktail."
