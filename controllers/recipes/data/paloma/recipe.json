    "name": "Paloma",
    "description": "Hailing from the heart of Mexico, the Paloma is a beloved tequila-based cocktail that often overshadows the famous Margarita in its homeland. This refreshing libation combines the earthy notes of tequila with the sweet and tangy burst of grapefruit soda, underscored by a splash of lime for a citrusy kick. Typically garnished with a salt rim and a slice of lime, the Paloma is a vivacious, sparkling salute to the vibrant spirit of Mexico.",
