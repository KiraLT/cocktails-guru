    "description": "Although its origins are not as well-documented as some classic cocktails, the Tropical Dream is a recent addition to the mixology world that transports you to an exotic island getaway. This cocktail beautifully amalgamates the tropical flavors of pineapple and coconut rum, accentuated by a dash of blue curaçao that lends a vibrant azure hue. Served over ice and garnished with a pineapple slice or cherry, the Tropical Dream is a feast for both the eyes and the palate, bringing the essence of a tropical vacation to your glass.",
