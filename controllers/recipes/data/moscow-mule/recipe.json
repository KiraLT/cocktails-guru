    "name": "Moscow Mule",
    "description": "Born in 1941 Los Angeles out of a collaboration between a vodka distributor and a ginger beer maker, the Moscow Mule is a testament to marketing genius. This Cold War era cocktail balances the clear, smooth strength of vodka with the spicy fizz of ginger beer, coupled with a tangy squeeze of lime. Served in its iconic copper mug to keep the drink ice-cold, the Moscow Mule offers a refreshing kick that's both bold and historically intriguing.",
    "instructions": [

        "Garnish with a lime lime wheel and mint."
