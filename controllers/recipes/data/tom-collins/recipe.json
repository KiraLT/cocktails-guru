    "name": "Tom Collins",
    "description": "A cocktail with a rich history dating back to 19th-century London, the Tom Collins is a timeless and refreshing gin-based drink. It pairs the botanical complexities of gin with the tartness of fresh lemon juice, balanced by a touch of simple syrup, and topped up with a splash of club soda for effervescence. Served in a 'Collins' glass over ice and often garnished with a lemon slice and a cherry, the Tom Collins is the epitome of classic refreshment.",
